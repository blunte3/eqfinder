# EqFinder: Interactive Graph for Decision Boundaries

EqFinder is an interactive graph application that enables users to draw lines and decision boundaries effortlessly. The drawn lines are then analyzed, and their corresponding equations are provided, making it a valuable tool for individuals involved in machine learning and data evaluation, even with limited coding experience.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** EqFinder provides an intuitive canvas where users can draw lines or decision boundaries directly.

- **Real-time Equation Discovery:** As the user draws lines on the graph, the application promptly determines the mathematical equations representing the drawn shapes.

- **Machine Learning Applications:** This tool is particularly useful for scenarios involving machine learning and data evaluation. Users can visually explore and experiment with decision boundaries without extensive coding knowledge.

## Usage

1. **Drawing Lines:**
   - Simply click and drag on the graph canvas to draw lines or decision boundaries.
   - For straight lines, you can hold down the mouse in the same spot for a second, and the drawn line will automatically turn into a straight line. The angle of the straight line can be adjusted with an anchor point.

2. **Equation Display:**
   - The equation of the drawn line or decision boundary is dynamically displayed on the screen.

3. **Reset Functionality:**
   - A reset button is provided to clear all drawn lines and start fresh.

4. **Coordinate Axes:**
   - The graph includes coordinate axes with tick marks for ease of reference.

## Use Cases

- **Machine Learning Exploration:** Explore and visualize decision boundaries for machine learning models.
  
- **Data Analysis:** Quickly prototype and evaluate data separation with visualized lines and boundaries.

- **Educational Purposes:** Introduce concepts of lines and equations in a practical and interactive manner, suitable for educational environments.
